        Spinoza emphatically rejected Cartesian interactionism. For him, extended nature is an entirely closed system.
        All the determinations of body, including not just quantity of motion but also direction, 
        are wholly accounted for by the causal determination of other bodies, combined with the nature of the body in question.
        Spinoza makes this quite clear in Ip28:
        Every singular thing, or any thing which is finite and has a determinate existence,
        can neither exist nor be determined to produce an effect unless it is determined to exist and produce an effect by another cause,
        which is also finite and has a determinate existence â€¦ and so on, to infinity.
